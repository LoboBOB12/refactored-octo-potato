 Abstract. The hyper elastic connective tissue structure of figure skaters (Marfan-like phenotype) and early physical activity with sport stress predispose to the development of autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT), with the risk of AIT being four times higher in the Marfan-like phenotype (13.3% versus 3.3%) than in the general population. A total of 37 well-known figure skaters (8 men and 29 women) aged 9 to 76 years (mean age 29±2.7 years) were studied. Among them: 2 Olympic champions, 3 world champions, 2 European champions, champions of Spain, Russia, France, coaches, junior skaters. All had drowsiness, fatigue, chills, dry skin, hyperkeratosis of the elbows, alopecia, facial plasticity, mucous cheek bites (Stroev's symptom ). Levels of TSH, T3, FT3, T4, FT4, antithyroid autoantibodies to TG, TPO and TSH, cortisol (CS), prolactin (PRL) receptors were examined. Almost all figure skaters showed signs of connective tissue dysplasia, AIT and hypothyroidism (TSH level in figure skaters was 2-2. 2 times higher than in the control group, and the average level of autoantibodies to TPO was almost 100 times higher. AIT has a pronounced negative effect on athletic performance, which is particularly noticeable in figure skating, where the technique of each movement is very important.   AIT worsens the skaters' quality of life outside of training, with constant drowsiness, fatigue and dry skin. AIT reduces the body's ability to adapt (the CS/PRL level in the overall group (2.48) is 1.5 times higher than in the control group (1.78), and in the junior group (3.31) it is even doubled). 
   Prevention of AIT in figure skaters (FS) should be based  on screening tests of thyroid hormone levels (primarily TSH and AA to TG and TPO). All young athletes who have chosen figure skating as a sport must undergo a thyroid screening test from the first days of their training.   Coaches should be educated to understand the pathology of connective tissue and the thyroid gland,
Key words: antithyroid autoantibodies, autoimmune thyroiditis, figure skating, hypothyroidism, levothyroxine, marfanoid phenotype.

Introduction. 
Russian figure skaters (FS) occupy a leading position in world sport.  This beautiful theatrical figure skating show is one of the most popular sports among children and teenagers. However, the aesthetics of figure skating cannot be compared to the grueling physical effort and stress involved. Figure skaters are a high-risk group for injuries ((bruises, fractures of the tibia, ankle and metatarsal bones from multi-rotation jumps, meniscus destruction, torn ligaments, etc.).). Fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome are typical [7]. Due to the congenital connective tissue pathology of the Marfan-like (MF) phenotype and its "gutta-percha" (elastic) nature, almost all of them have spinal and hip dysplasia (allowing them to easily do the splits), heart anomalies (prolapsed valves, false chords), vascular malformations (aortic and cerebral aneurysms) - the latter being highly associated with the risk of sudden death. For example, Sergei Grinkov, Honoured Sportsman of the USSR and Russia and World Champion in pairs figure skating, died suddenly on the ice at the age of 28. In February 2020, it was reported that the famous Ukrainian figure skater Nikolai Bondar died suddenly of cardiac arrest at the age of 30.   In March 2020, another famous figure skater of Japanese descent, Chris Reed, 30, (8 gold medals) died suddenly.
Constant food restrictions, the panic of daily weighing, and feelings of inferiority due to uncontrolled bulimia create chronic stress in figure skaters, accompanied by hyperprolactinemia and hypercortisolism  which trigger the onset of obesity. The combination of these concurrent pathological processes often leads to uncontrolled adolescent obesity with pink striae (Simpson-Page syndrome), a juvenile form of metabolic syndrome and a frequent cause of early termination of the figure skater's brilliant career, often with a tragic outcome [5, 6].
Individuals with MF have been shown to have a number of neurohumoral features that predispose them to autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) and hypothyroidism.  According to the literature, the risk of AIT in individuals with the MF phenotype is four times higher than in the general population (13.3% versus 3.3%) [14-16, 19].
  Professional figure skaters face a wide range of medical conditions, from metabolic disorders associated with grueling training and strict diets to serious mechanical injuries. Due to the life and health risks of the latter, they should be the focus of special attention by coaches and sports physicians. Impairment of athletic performance can be due to malnutrition, bad habits, infections, haematological diseases and often endocrinopathies. [18]. A thorough   investigation of potentially reversible underlying conditions is therefore warranted. This is especially true when disorders occur during training, competition and recovery. [21]. 
  According to Luksch J.R., Collins P.B. (21), thyroid dysfunction should be considered in athletes with the suspected disease. As might be expected, athletes may have serum laboratory values that do not correlate exactly with the signs and symptoms they present, so the clinical picture may not be entirely clear. The picture is even more confusing in people under significant physiological stress who are using anabolic agents or exogenous thyroid hormones. Connective tissue disorders and autoimmune Hashimoto's thyroiditis in figure skaters have been investigated in isolated studies. [1-3, 5, 10]. 
The aim of this article was to investigate the clinical presentation and outcome of Hashimoto's autoimmune thyroiditis, a common community disease, in figure skaters.
Methods and organisation of the study. From 2006 to 2021, 37 people (female - 29, male - 8) aged 9 to 76 years (mean age 29±2.7 years), directly involved in professional figure skating, were observed at the St. Petersburg Family Medicine Clinic "BaltMedHavan" (chief physician - A.Y. Novikov, endocrinologist - Y.I. Stroev). Among them were Olympic champions (2), world champions (4), European champions (4), French champions (1), Spanish champions (1), members of the Russian national team, winners of the Universiades, Olympic silver and bronze medalists, world and European champions, honorary masters of sport, famous coaches. In addition to citizens of the Russian Federation, respondents included citizens of the USA (1), France (1) and Finland (3). All studies were conducted with the voluntary consent of the volunteers. None had been treated with levothyroxine prior to the study.
Study methods included medical history, examination, laboratory analysis data [clinical and biochemical blood tests, enzyme immunoassay for thyroid hormone (TSH), total and free triiodothyronine (T3, free T3), total and free thyroxine (T4, freeT4), anti-thyroid autoantibodies to thyroglobulin (AT to TH) and thyroid peroxidase (AT to TPO), to TSH (AT to PTH), prolactin (PRL) and cortisol (CC) receptors] and instrumental data (ultrasound of the thyroid, heart and abdomen; MRI of the brain). 
The CP/PRL index, an index of body adaptation, was calculated [17]. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel and Statistics. 	The significance of differences between groups in the frequencies of rank variables was determined using the chi-squared test according to the standard formula. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05 [18].The control group consisted of 31 healthy volunteers aged 13-39 years (mean age - 25.09 ± 1.23 years).
Results and discussion    The majority of patients complained of marked fatigue, severe tiredness and dry skin. Diffuse alopecia occurred in 18 people, hyperkeratosis of the elbow skin (geroderma) - in 6 people, pronounced drowsiness - in 5 people, constant coldness of the feet - in 5 people, pastosity with mucosal bites (Stroev's symptom) - in 6 figure skaters. A part of active skaters noticed a decrease in sports performance, lack of energy and desire to train, insecurity in performing already known elements.
According to anamnestic and objective data, all patients examined had a combination of different stigmata of connective tissue dysplasia of Marfan-like phenotype [MTPD]: joint hypermobility, scoliosis, flat feet, nephroptosis, gallbladder deformities, mitral valve prolapse, false chords of the left ventricle, pathological dental growth, myopia, astigmatism, etc., abnormal development of cerebral vessels. One example is an MRI scan of the neck and brain vessels of a two-time Olympic figure skating champion at the age of 25: 
    " The MRI angiography of the neck vessels shows that one trunk of the carotid artery branches off from the aortic arch, near the mouth of the left vertebral artery, and the other from the left subclavian artery. This (posterior) trunk passes through the left transverse foramen C6, continues forward, joins the anterior trunk and, joining the left vertebral artery, re-enters the transverse process canal at the level of C5.  There was no evidence of pathological changes in the brain. Doubling of the proximal left subclavian artery with its moderate hypoplasia was detected. The congenital tortuosity of the right vertebral artery, leading to clinical manifestations of venous insufficiency through the right subclavian vein, is apparently caused by its short-term compression by the hypertrophied muscles of the shoulder girdle. The cerebral fissures are moderately dilated. The cranial part of the great cisterna is dilated. The subarachnoid space is unchanged.   The medial brain structures are unchanged. The craniocervical junction is intact. The common trunk calibre of the left subclavian artery is smaller than that of the right. The main artery is curved to the left.   The curvature of the right vertebral artery with an additional coil is at the level of C5. The calibre of the common internal carotid arteries is unchanged. The left subclavian vein is normal in location and calibre . The left external and internal jugular veins are wider than those of the symmetrical side”. 
Obviously, the prognosis for a skater with such a vascular anomaly is completely unpredictable in the case of physical overload.
 The distribution of figure skaters by age is shown in Figure 1.

  No significant differences in TTG levels were found between the junior and veteran groups (p ˃ 0.05), but their higher level (2.07±0.3 mU/mL), miU/mL compared to the control group - 0.99±0.03 mU/mL (p ˂ 0. 01) indicated that both junior and veteran figure skaters had hypothyroidism by conventional criteria, requiring compensation with thyroid hormone (levothyroxine). (Fig. 2). This can only be explained by the fact that each figure skater, regardless of age, has a different degree of unrecognized and therefore untreated hypothyroidism. For example, 6 out of 37 skaters (16.2%) had highly pathological values between 4.3 and 8.7 µM/ml. This means that almost one in five figure skaters surveyed needed to get treated for hypothyroidism.

There is no doubt that the cause of hypothyroidism in the skaters studied was Hashimoto's AIT, which developed against the background of an accentuated Marfan's-like connective tissue dysplasia, resulting in an enviable, but apparently not entirely desirable, excessive elasticity of the body demonstrated during competitions.                
The anti-thyroid autoantibodies detected in various concentrations indicated AIT: the anti-thyroid autoantibody levels ranged from 0 to 752 IU/ml and those of anti-TPO from 0 to 877 IU/ml. It is true that the level of anti-thyroid autoantibodies can vary depending on the autoimmunity status. However, according to some sources, in 3.5% of individuals with AIT, both TPO and Tg antibodies may be absent despite a clear clinical picture of hypothyroidism and histomorphological evidence of AIT, but may occasionally manifest (11). 
   Very pronounced differences were found in the levels of antithyroid autoantibodies between the groups: 48±2.51 IU/ml for antibodies against Tg antibodies (in the control group - 47±0.33 IU/ml) and 156±54 IU/ml for TPO antibodies (in the control group - 1.73±0.78 IU/ml).These data indicate a high level of immune autoaggression in the group of figure skaters (Figures 3, 4).

There was a statistically significant difference in the CP/PRL index between the junior and veteran groups: 3.31±0.15 and 1.78±0.26, respectively. The CP/PRL index value in the general group (2.48±0.3) was 1.5 times higher than in the control group (1.78±0.11) (p˂0.01), and even 2 times higher in the junior group (3.31±0.21) (p˂0.001). This result may indicate a more acute decrease in adaptation in young athletes, presumably associated with a higher level of physical exertion and stress in young athletes with a problem of sport climbing and competitive struggle compared to merit figure skaters with predominantly coaching activities.

  Figure skaters with AIT and clear clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism were prescribed age-appropriate doses of thyroid hormone. Young figure skaters were prescribed a dose of levothyroxine (Euthyrox) of 1.6-1.8 µg/kg body weight, while the dose for veteran skaters was individualized, starting with low doses (6.25-12.5 µg/day) and gradually increasing the dose until the euthyroid state was reached. The use of iodized salt was strictly forbidden, as was the use of iodine-containing preparations, food supplements with seaweed, sushi with seaweed (rolls), treatment of abrasions and bruises with iodine, application of iodine nets(meshes) to the skin, etc. AIT was first described in 1912, not in Europe, but in Japan, where people have been eating iodine-rich foods since ancient times. Based on the extensive clinical experience of European doctors, it has already been scientifically proven that iodine, as one of the strongest adjuvants, aggravates autoimmune processes and is absolutely contraindicated in AIT patients [12, 23].
In all figure skaters with signs of hypothyroidism as a result of autoimmune thyroiditis, continuous treatment with levothyroxine significantly improved their well-being and condition, and significantly increased their creative performance. According to some figure skaters, taking adequate doses of levothyroxine had almost magical effects: their well-being and mood improved significantly, fatigue and chills disappeared, the skin became normal, general pallor disappeared, energy and the desire to do sport, which had been lost before treatment, returned, and sporting results improved.



  Incidentally, levothyroxine (Euthyrox), which is taken by athletes as a life-saving medication on the recommendation of an endocrinologist, is not yet classified as doping.
Conclusion.    High physical and emotional stress, which rapidly depletes the body's reserves, and the marfanoid phenotype specific to figure skaters predispose to the development of endocrine abnormalities, especially AIT.  According to clinical and laboratory data, practically all the figure skaters studied had stigmata  of connective tissue dysplasia of the marfanoid phenotype with varying degrees of hypothyroidism due to late diagnosis of AIT (regardless of age, the TSH level in figure skaters was 2-2.2 times higher than in the control group, and the average level of autoantibodies to TPO was almost 100 times higher). AIT reduces the adaptive capacity of figure skaters by 1.5-2 times due to chronic stress  causing an increase in both cortisol levels (in our observations - up to 1392 nM/l!) and prolactin levels, a potent stimulator of autoimmunity [5, 9, 23].  This aggravates the autoimmune process in the thyroid gland and is accompanied by the development of autoimmune hypophysitis resulting in a pituitary microadenoma - prolactinoma, which, according to our data, is detected on contrast-enhanced pituitary MRI in almost half of adolescents with AIT in combination with obesity with pink striae [5]. Such a situation can be crucial for figure skaters, both for achieving sporting success and for leading a normal life in which sport is a central part of an athlete's vocation.   
In view of the above, the issue of competent medical support and careful coaching for young figure skaters is of particular importance. At the first clinical signs of thyroid pathology, figure skaters should be referred to an endocrinologist, without trying to psychologically influence their motivation, which is often the sin of individual coaches  10)who, for obvious reasons, have a sporting rather than a medical mindset. Coaches should be educated to understand the nature of these conditions.
Importantly, in the hands of a competent endocrinologist, timely diagnosis and effective treatment of AIT and hypothyroidism are not particularly difficult. For this reason, all young athletes, taking up figure skating as a sport, should be screened from the first days of training to detect life-threatening connective tissue abnormalities and AIT, especially in the event of a sudden decline in athletic performance, which, we believe, in figure skaters is most often due to unrecognized AIT resulting in hypothyroidism.
